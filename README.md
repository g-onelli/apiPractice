# apiPractice
While designing this program I tried to think of what would make the tester's job easier. From previous experience I knew that having smaller functions that focused on one task instad of multiple tasks were easier to check on. By having it this way, I learned a lot more about what was going wrong just by the function name than I would otherwise. It also provides easy breakpoints which in their own way act as validation because how far the program progresses in the chain of functions shows that the inputs and output were at least functional enough to pass through the python complier. I was also trying to make things have names that made sense and related to their functionality. That way it wasn't just a failure of veriable 203, but failure in getGithubAccount with variable githubResponse. As for testing, automating tests is still relatively new to me so the whole process is kind of unfamiliar and uncomfortable for me. The manual tests were easer, but since I used a lot of assertEquals, it wasn't too hard.
